# Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression and XGBoost

## Overview
Built an ML model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using XGBoost, SHAP for explainability, and advanced metrics for evaluation.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and testing was downloaded from Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection).
- Highly imbalanced: 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost Classifier with tuned hyperparameters

## Evaluation
- ROC-AUC: 0.98
- Precision/Recall
- SHAP 

## Key Visuals
- ROC Curve
- Confusion Matrix
- SHAP Summary Plot
